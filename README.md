# ProtobuffSerial
This is an Arduino library that utilizes Google's protocol buffers in order to implement a flexible communication system.

### Getting started
The easiest way to get started with using this library is to first build and run the example sketches. But before you do that,
you must install the library. To do that, clone/download this repository to your Arduino Libraries folder:

```
cd arduino-1.6.11/libraries
git clone 
```
